# ElevatorSystemJAVA

Question:

 

Design a lift management system for a building of 100 to 150 stories with 10 – 20 lifts in the building with each having a capacity between 10 – 15 people at a time. Each floor in the building houses 100 -150 people. Your system should be able to generate events like people using the floors to move in/out between various floors. You can emulate office start, office end, lunch and break timings to vary the load on the system.  The system should work on goals like less time to move between floor A to floor B, Utilize maximum capacity, intelligent floor routing etc. The lifts should exhibit behaviors like stopping time, acceleration and de-acceleration in a realistic manner. You could use a timer and use it accelerate a whole day of activity in a few minutes of the application run.
